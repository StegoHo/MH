		<p>Hi, I’m Meng-Hsuan Ho, or you can call me Stego [Stay-go]. I am from Taiwan and currently pursuing my Master degree in Business Analytics in Arizona State University. “Passionate” & “bold to step out of the comfort zone” are captions that highlight my personality, and they also help navigate my future career aspiration as a Data Analyst. Feel free to reach me via the box below. Let’s exchange something interesting and crazy!</p>

					<h3>Something about me</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Baseball is my intitial interest in data. I like to think that each ball pitched is independent and identically distributed, so all the statisitcs and econometrics would come to work.
				</p>
				<p>
				Also, I like to explore and record things through camera. Sometimes, I go hiking or to ruins to search for ideas for pictures. All the photos, mostly about landscape, posted on this website are my perception of pictures.
